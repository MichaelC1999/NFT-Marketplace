# NFT-Marketplace

https://michaelc1999.github.io/NFT-Marketplace/

This project is my first dive into Solidity and blockchain development. I have been following Cryptocurrency markets since 2015, and as of the beginning of 2021 began to learn the technical foundation behind blockchains and smart contracts. In this project, I wrote some basic smart contracts to mint NFTs and store them in the market on the blockchain. These smart contracts were built with OpenZeppelin and include various custom functions that I wrote to process transactions and display market data. The frontend is built with Next.js and uses Hardhat, Web3Modal, and Ethers in various stages of the testing and deployment processes. The NFT market was deployed onto the Ethereum Rinkeby test network. My intention with this project was to keep it lightweight and without any server just for the purpose of utilizing newly-learned Solidity + Web3 concepts. The master branch contains the development code and builds into the build branch upon each push to master.
